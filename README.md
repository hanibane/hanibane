- 👋 Hi, I’m Hani
- 👀 I’m interested in language learning (not programming languages :) ). I'm familiar with JavaScript and I have solid knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on development of [Langoid](https://langoid.com), free platform for languages learning.
- 💞️ You can reach me if you want to discuss about language learning or saving languagews from dying.
